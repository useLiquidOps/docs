### Earning Yield

Earning yield is a great way to grow your assets passively while also contributing to the growth and stability of the Arweave and AO ecosystem.&#x20;

Let’s break down how it works and all the ways to do it right now in the ecosystem!

### What does it Mean to Earn Yield?

Think of it as earning interest for your money, but instead of a bank, you do it on crypto platforms.&#x20;

In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), yield is usually earned by contributing assets to protocols/platforms that put them to use in many ways, like lending, staking or providing liquidity.

### All the Ways to Earn Yield in the Arweave and AO Ecosystem

#### Botega

Botega is a DEX within the Arweave ecosystem that offers decentralized finance (DeFi) tools.

You can earn rewards through Botega, by providing liquidity, which means making your tokens available for others in the ecosystem to swap with.

It’s an easy way to earn passive income by putting your tokens to work.

#### Permaswap

Permaswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for trading tokens. By providing tokens, you contribute to the exchange function by providing others the liquidity they need to trade.&#x20;

As a reward, you earn a share of the fees generated by these trades.&#x20;

As there is no need to manage your tokens after they’ve been added, it is an easy way to earn passive income.

#### The AO stETH Bridge

The AO stETH Bridge is designed for people who hold stETH, a type of Ethereum token representing staked ETH.

By depositing stETH into the AO bridge, it gets stored safely on Ethereum, while you earn daily rewards in AO tokens. The rewards grow based on the amount of stETH you stake.&#x20;

These AO tokens have been tradable since February 2025, making this an excellent long-term earning option.

#### Holding AR to earn AO

Another way to earn AO is simply holding AR tokens in your wallet. Doing this allows you to earn AO tokens automatically, like earning interest in a savings account.

You earn based on the number of AR tokens you hold. (Currently, for every AR you hold, you earn about 0.016 AO per year.)

All of these options – Whether you’re holding AR, staking stETH, or using platforms like Botega and Permaswap –  provide an easy way to grow your assets passively in the Arweave & AO ecosystems!
