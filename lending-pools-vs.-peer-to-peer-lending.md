### P2P vs Lending Pools

Lending pools and P2P (peer-to-peer) lending are both forms of decentralized lending and borrowing. Although they serve the same purpose, they are different in many ways.&#x20;

Let's compare them based on a few aspects!

### Mechanism

P2P lending allows one-on-one interactions directly between lenders and borrowers, usually through a platform that matches them with each other.

Lending pools, on the other hand, collect funds from multiple lenders into a shared pool, allowing borrowers to draw from it. This method is more commonly used in DeFi.

### Parties Involved

In P2P lending, both parties are actively involved in negotiating terms such as interest rates and repayment schedules.

Lending pools simplify this process â€“ lenders contribute to the pool, and borrowers interact with the pool directly.

### Liquidity

P2P lending typically locks funds for the duration of the loan, making it less flexible.

Lending pools often provide greater liquidity, allowing lenders to withdraw or trade their positions, depending on the platform's design.

### Fees

P2P platforms may charge fees for connecting borrowers with lenders and for managing loans.

Lending pools typically use automation to simplify operations, which can help reduce costs (platform fees might still apply).

### Use cases

P2P lending is ideal for customized loans where borrowers and lenders have specific preferences

Lending pools, with their automated and scalable structure, are ideal for DeFi applications, such as trading, staking, and quick access to funds.

LiquidOps utilizes the lending pool approach, ensuring flexibility and maximizing your earning potential. The protocol also aims to bring in as many advantages of lending as possible.
