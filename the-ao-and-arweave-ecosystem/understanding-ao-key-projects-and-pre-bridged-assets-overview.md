### **Introduction to AO and Its Ecosystem**

With the development of new platforms blockchain technology continues to evolve, becoming more and more fast and efficient. AO is one of these platforms, created to improve blockchain performance.

Let’s look into what AO does, the assets in its system, and the key projects driving it forward!

### **What is AO?**

AO is a decentralized execution layer designed for enhancing the stability and performance of blockchain applications.&#x20;

Unlike regular blockchains where memory is "shared" between Smart Contracts, AO avoids creating dependencies and uses a mechanism similar to the CPU of computers by isolating "processes". These processes can communicate with each other using messages.

### Pre-Bridged Assets

Bridging is the process of moving assets between blockchains, enabling them to work together.

Pre-bridged assets are tokens that are designed to easily move across blockchains, allowing them to be used within many different platforms within the AO ecosystem.

### Key Projects in the AO Ecosystem

#### LiquidOps

Our project, LiquidOps is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform built for Arweave and AO assets. It allows users to earn interest and/or access liquidity by using their digital assets as collateral.

#### Protocol.Land

Protocol Land is a decentralized platform for hosting open-source code. Built on Arweave’s blockweave, it stores code permanently and securely, allowing developers to collaborate in a censorship-free environment.

#### Botega

Botega is a decentralized exchange (DEX) for Arweave, where users can trade freely with no middlemen. It uses Arweave’s secure, permanent storage for transparent transactions and allows autonomous trading through agents.

#### Astro USD

USDA is a stablecoin in the AO ecosystem, backed by $AR. It’s designed to stay stable and provide liquidity, with the Quantum Bridge allowing easy transfer between Arweave and AO.

### Other Important Projects

Other important projects in the AO ecosystem include ArFleet, Bazar, Wander, Perplex, Permaswap and ArNS, which contribute to expanding the decentralized infrastructure.&#x20;

These projects are helping grow the AO ecosystem, making blockchain faster, more decentralized, and transparent. As AO develops, it’s creating a better future for blockchain technology.
