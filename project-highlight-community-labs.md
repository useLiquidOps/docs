### What is Community Labs?

Community Labs is a company that builds and supports software tools for Arweave and AO, two technologies that focus on permanent and secure data storage on the internet.&#x20;

Letâ€™s see what they do exactly!

### What is Arweave?

Arweave is a decentralized storage network designed for permanent, tamper-proof data storage.&#x20;

Unlike traditional cloud solutions that rely on subscriptions and can remove or alter data over time, Arweave ensures that your data lives on.

### What is AO?

AO is a decentralized execution layer that enhances blockchain application performance by isolating processes instead of sharing memory.&#x20;

This approach allows processes to communicate via messages. It also introduces autonomous organizations, enabling composable smart contracts for next-gen Web3 applications.

### What does Community Labs do?

Community Labs creates tools and services that make it easier for developers and businesses to use Arweave and AO:

* Develop Software Tools: They build applications that help people interact with Arweave. One of their major projects is Wander (formerly ArConnect), a digital wallet that allows users to store and manage their assets on the Arweave network.&#x20;
* Support New Projects: They provide funding, mentorship, and business advice to startups that want to build on Arweave and AO.
* Offer Development and Marketing Services: Community Labs helps companies design, develop, and promote their decentralized applications (dApps).

### Why is it Important?

Community Labs is building the infrastructure, tools, and support needed to speed up decentralized innovation on Arweave and AO.&#x20;

By funding and mentoring startups and developing user-friendly applications, they make decentralization practical, adaptable, and impactful.
