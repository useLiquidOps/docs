# The LiquidOps Fair Launch

### What is an AO fair launch?

Via the decentralized funding network, The Permaweb Index, users in the AO/Arweave ecosystem can delegate AO yield that is currently being earned on AR tokens towards ecosystem fair launches.

In exchange they get back the project's token, without transferring their underlying AR tokens and the project receives AO/PI through the Permaweb Index.

In short, the AO/Arweave communities receive LQD and LiquidOps receives decentralised funding.

### LQD Tokenomics

[LQD](the-lqd-token.md), the native token of LiquidOps has a maximum supply of 50,000,000 tokens, distributed as follows:

**28% DAO**
