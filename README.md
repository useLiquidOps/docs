LiquidOps is a lending and borrowing protocol that providers users the ability to earn interest on their Arweave and AO assets. As well as borrowers the ability to use that lent liquidity in various decentralised applications.

It has been modeled after the successful Ethereum native money market [Compound V2](https://docs.compound.finance/v2/).
