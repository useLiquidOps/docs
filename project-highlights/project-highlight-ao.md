# Project Highlight: AO

### What is AO?

AO is a decentralized execution layer designed for enhancing the stability and performance of blockchain applications. Unlike traditional blockchains – where all smart contracts share the same memory – AO separates each process to its own isolated state, where they can still communicate through messages, but they don't interfere with each other's operations.

### What does AO do?

AO fixes one of the biggest problems with current blockchains: they can only do one thing at a time. AO lets unlimited processes run at the same time without slowing each other down.

Its main features include:

* **Parallel Processing**\
  AO can run many processes at once instead of waiting in line. This makes apps much faster and lets developers build things that weren't possible before.
*   **Multiple Virtual Machines**

    Developers can choose different environments to run their apps in, and they all work together without competing for resources.
*   **Flexible Design**

    Everything in AO can be swapped out or upgraded. The messaging system, virtual machines, and other parts can all be changed.
*   **Permanent Storage**

    All computations and results are stored forever on Arweave, so everything is transparent and can be checked by anyone.
*   **Cross-Chain Assets**

    Assets can easily move between different blockchains, so tokens from one blockchain can be used on AO and vice versa.

### How Does It Work?

AO works through several key components, such as:

* **Message System:**\
  Instead of sharing memory like traditional blockchains, processes in AO send messages to each other. This lets them work independently without conflicts.
*   **Built on Arweave:**

    All data is stored permanently on Arweave, so nothing gets lost and everything can be verified.
*   **Separate Processes:**

    Each app or function runs in its own space, so they can't slow each other down or interfere with each other.
*   **Resource Sharing:**

    The network can share computing power and storage across different nodes, making everything more efficient.

### Current Projects and Applications

The AO ecosystem has grown quickly with many projects already building on it. Key projects include [Perplex](project-highlight-perplex.md) for perpetual contract trading, LiquidOps for lending and borrowing, and [Botega](project-highlight-botega.md) and Permaswap for decentralized exchanges.

The ecosystem also features essential infrastructure like Protocol.Land for permanent code storage, Wander as a user-friendly wallet, and Bazar as a marketplace platform. [Astro USD](project-highlight-astro.md) (USDA) provides a stable currency backed by AR tokens, while ArNS makes the platform more accessible with simple, readable names instead of complex addresses.

### Why is it important?

AO solves a major problem in blockchain technology: speed and scalability. AO's design lets it handle high-speed trading while still being completely decentralized and transparent. By combining permanent storage from Arweave with fast parallel processing, AO makes it possible to build complex apps that can compete with traditional centralized services. This opens the door for the next generation of Web3 applications, from advanced trading platforms to AI-powered tools that can run completely on-chain.
